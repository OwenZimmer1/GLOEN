Notes for the backend

Things we need to do:

 - Data Security
 - Authentication
 - Error Management
 - Hosting
 - Mobile or Web
 - Source Control
 - Preprocessing
 - 


Platforms that need to use and how
	- Azure:

	
	- .Net


	- SQL


BIG TAKEAWAYS:
	- Navigate to results page when done
	- Error Checking
	- Timeout when error or confirmation fails
	- Querying storage


Error Handling: (Waiting for backend implementation)
Image does not display because problem with Blob Storage
You tried to retrieve image but blob storage failed
Timeout, file was deleted, file name was changed
Heavy traffic on the site leading to Timeouts
Display “ImageNotFound” Icon (default image)
Try: From Blob 
Catch Statement: Display “ImageNotFound” Icon

Save that in backend so that next time, it will be “saved” in favorites
